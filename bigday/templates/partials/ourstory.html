                            <p class="text-black-50 my-5 mb-0">It began in the lecture halls, where knowledge was shared,</p>
                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Where books were our compass, and dreams were declared.</p>
                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Amid deadlines and coffee, in Stag Hill's embrace,</p>
                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Sophia and Chris' hearts found a rhythm, a slow, steady pace.</p>
                            <p class="my-5 mb-0">From Surrey's library whispers to long walks to the dorm,</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">Through seasons of study, our friendship was drawn.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">A coursework romance, built lesson by lesson,</p>
                            <p class="mb-0">Until love took its place, our most precious confession.</p>
                            <p class="text-black-50 my-5 mb-0">Between ivy-clad walls and River Thames that gleam,</p>
                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">We painted our future, the start of a dream.</p>
                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">And as we step into foreverâ€™s embrace,</p>
                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">We carry our story of love, time, and grace.</p>
